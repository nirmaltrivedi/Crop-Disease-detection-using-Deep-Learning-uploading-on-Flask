# Crop-detection-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-uploading-on-Flask

This is an end to end deep learning project in agriculture domain. Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. The diseases in plants can be classified by dividing them into 3 categories: Early Blight, Healthy and Late Blight. 

We will train a convolutional neural network in tensorflow using potato plant images. The goal of this model would be to classify these images as either healthy or early blight or late blight.

After the model is built, we'll use Flask to deploy the model by using JS and HTML. The end user will enter the data image and will get the output. Please refer the attached flowchart to have a better understanding of model building and other steps. 

I've also uploaded the video of using the project live. Please refer the video through the following link url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xGxPV29PwU

Technologies used:

Model Building: Tensorflow, CNN, Data augmentation

Backend Server : Flask, HTML, JS, CSS
